        <h2>About the CCC</h2>
        <p>
          The Civilian Climate Corps — a New Deal Era 'Civilian Conservation Corps' reinvented for the contemporary threat of climate change in the US — is closer to reality than it's ever has been. What only a few years ago might have seemed like a progressive policy pipe dream, now is on the cusp of creation. As of the summer of 2021,  Democratic lawmakers have
          <u><a href="https://neguse.house.gov/imo/media/doc/CCC%20Letter%20-%20Final%20Signed%20(004).pdf" target="_blank">proposed</a></u> a vision for the program and its formal creation is expected by some by the end of the year.</p>
          &nbsp;
        <p>
          Despite the inevitability of the CCC, we still don't know exactly what it will look like yet. Much of the design impetus for the idea has extended from the popular legacy of its New Deal predecessor. But the two programs exist over 100 years of vastly difering societal and environmental contexts. It's not uncommon to hear lawmakers and media outlets offer up buzzy words like resiliency, mitigation, jobs, infrastructure, and the like, to explain the CCC. Much is left up for imagination.</p>
          &nbsp;
        <p>
          The CCC has the potential to confront several incredibly pressing problems the US faces. Clearly it's poised to mobilize a boots-on-the-ground response to climate change. Just as much as it's a technical solution it's a social solution as well. It will grant young people an opportunity to connect to and steward the natural environment in a way that seems increasingly untenable. Even if it remains undecided just how it will operate, it's clear that there's historic upside to a CCC designed thoughtfully and run intelligently.

        <h2>About the Civilian Climate Futures Project</h2>
        <p>
          The Civilian Climate Futures Project is a direct response to the unrealized nature of the CCC. Its objective is simple: give potential beneficiaries of the CCC a vision for what the program can look and feel like.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          Taking inspiration from the “ambiguous utopias” of the late science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin, we decided to use storytelling as a method of imagining higher fidelity visions for the CCC. Our first attempts at this are three short pieces of speculative fiction.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          Moving forward we would like to publish additional stories and are interested in talking with more authors, especially those from diverse backgrounds. Even if you don't consider yourself a writer but are interested in the ideas of this project, we would love to hear from you.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          Ultimately we hope to shape into reality a CCC that is thrilling, just, fulfilling, impactful, and fun. If you're motivated to do the same, we hope you can join us.
